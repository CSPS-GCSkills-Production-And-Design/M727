							<h2>Module 1: Achieving High Performance in Federal buildings â€“ Video Transcript</h2>
                            <p>We will begin with Module 1: Achieving High Performance in Federal Buildings.</p>
                            <p>A sustainable strategy can be evaluated using a &ldquo;triple bottom line&rdquo; framework. The three components in this framework are: environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and economic prosperity. Successful sustainable strategies incorporate all three.</p>
                            <p>Environmental stewardship consists of protecting air, water, land, and ecosystems, as well as conserving resources, including fossil fuels.</p>
                            <p>Social responsibility involves improving the quality of life and equity for individuals, communities, and society as a whole.</p>
                            <p>Finally, economic prosperity involves reducing costs, adding value, and creating economic opportunities for individuals, organizations, communities, and nations.</p>
                            <p>While there are many facets to a Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan, this course will focus on four fundamentals:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Optimizing Energy Performance</li>
                                <li>Protection and Conservation of Water</li>
                                <li>Use of Environmentally Preferable Products and Materials</li>
                                <li>Enhanced Indoor Environmental Quality</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The first fundamental of sustainable facility management is the optimization of energy performance.</p>
                            <p>Supplies of fossil fuel are increasingly unreliable, concerns for energy security are on the rise, and the impacts of global climate change are becoming more evident. Sustainable and high-performance buildings are critical to reduce energy load, increase resource efficiency and maximize cost effective renewable energy technologies. Federal agencies are increasingly committed to significantly reducing our dependence on foreign energy sources and energy derived from fossil fuels.</p>
                            <p>Optimizing Energy Performance begins by reducing energy consumption and associated costs, increasing resource efficiency and maximizing the use of cost-effective renewable technologies. It is important to measure and verify energy use frequently in order to properly track performance over time.</p>
                            <p>This fundamental practice is in line with a federal commitment put forward in the Greening Government Strategy stating that the Government of Canada will reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from federal facilities and fleets by 80% below 2005 levels by 2050.</p>
                            <p>There are many benefits that can result from taking action on Optimizing Energy Performance.<br /> The environmental benefits are: lower electricity and fossil fuel use, lower GHG emissions and associated air pollution caused by fossil fuel production and distribution.</p>
                            <p>The economic benefits such as:</p>
                            <p>Lower first costs and operating costs when systems can be downsized due to integrated energy solutions, reduced dependence on imported oil, lower annual fuel and electricity costs, reduced peak power demand and cost and reduced need for new energy infrastructure.</p>
                            <p>The protection and conservation of water is another fundamental of sustainable facility management.</p>
                            <p>Although two-thirds of the earth&rsquo;s surface is water, less than one-half of one percent is available for our use.</p>
                            <p>By creating a strategic sustainability plan that uses water wisely we can reduce use and its associate energy and environmental impacts.</p>
                            <p>Much like energy, water use should be measured and verified frequently to track improvements over time and identify leaks.</p>
                            <p>The Federal Government is committed to the protection and conservation of water and has stated the following in the Greening Government Strategy:</p>
							<p>&ldquo;The Government of Canada will reduce its water consumption by: Tracking and disclosing its potable water consumption by 2022; using best-in-class water-use practices in new construction and major renovations; designing all new Crown-owned buildings to effectively manage storm water.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>The environmental benefits of taking action on preserving water include: lower potable water consumption and pollution discharged into our aquafers and waterways, the preservation of water resources for wildlife and agriculture and the restoration of wetland ecologies.</p>
                            <p>The economic benefits of protecting and conserving water include: reduced annual water costs, lower municipal costs for wastewater treatment and lower first cost for certain fixtures.</p>
                            <p>A sustainable building is constructed of materials that minimize life-cycle environmental impacts such as global climate change, resource depletion, and human toxicity. Environmentally preferable materials reduce waste and disposal costs, preserve the environment and contribute to employee health and safety.</p>
                            <p>Sustainable materials minimize life-cycle costs and reduce waste, they protect the health and safety of tenants, and they decrease the need for fossil fuels.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Canada is committed to reducing the environmental impact of building materials using life-cycle assessment techniques to minimize embodied carbon and the use of harmful materials in construction and renovation.</p>
                            <p>The Environmental Benefits are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>reduced mining, and harvesting of virgin resources</li>
                                <li>reduced strain on ecosystems from disposal</li>
                                <li>reduced energy use for material and resource transportation, manufacturing and processing</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The Economic Benefits are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>decreased first costs due to local material harvesting, material re-use, and use of recycled materials</li>
                                <li>lower costs for treatment and waste disposal</li>
                                <li>lower municipal costs for construction and operation of landfills</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Another Fundamentals of Sustainable Facility Management is Enhancing Indoor Environmental Quality.</p>
                            <p>Sustainable facility management avoids the use of harmful chemicals and materials, aims to improve air quality and create productive environments, and facilitates interactivity among building occupants. Even a small boost to worker productivity can result in savings that can offset the cost of improvements.</p>
                            <p>As part of its greening strategy, the Government of Canada will focus on the well-being of its employees and communities in which it operates by creating sustainable workplaces and mobilizing employees on greening government.</p>
                            <p>The environmental benefits related to improved indoor environmental quality include:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>better air quality inside the facility</li>
								<li>reduced volatile organic emissions</li>
								<li>reduced carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide emissions</li>
							</ul>
                            <p>The economic benefits of enhanced indoor environmental quality are:</p>
                            <ul>
								<li>healthier and more productive work environments</li>
								<li>higher organizational productivity</li>
								<li>lower absenteeism, and reduced staff turnover</li>
								<li>lower disability/health insurance costs</li>
							</ul>
                            <p>Energy and facility managers control more resources that potentially impact sustainability than most other professionals on site.</p>
                            <p>In the short term, they establish baselines, initiate projects, facilitate discussions with co-workers, and identify opportunities for teamwork and collaboration.</p>
                            <p>In the long term, they have the potential to create momentum and keep progress in focus as ongoing sustainability projects evolve.</p>
                            <p>Through their leadership, a tremendous change in energy and environmental quality is possible.</p>
                            <p>Sustainability is a cyclical process for continuous improvement and so requires a continuous effort. It should not be viewed as an end game with a finish line to cross.</p>
                            <p>Do whatever you can with the resources at hand, set a goal to move &ldquo;beyond compliance&rdquo; then improve upon your own benchmarks as you work toward your goals</p>
                            <p>Even if you can&rsquo;t meet the goals this year, how close can you get? Can you set your sights higher, and continually re-evaluate and improve your process? Always be in a listening mode to continually evaluate and look for new or enhanced sustainable measures to apply.</p>
                            <p>Because individuals determine how buildings are used and maintained, sustainability initiatives must recognize the critical connection between buildings and the people who use them.</p>
                            <p>Organizing a Sustainable Facility Team, or &ldquo;Green Team,&rdquo; is a proven way to engage individuals with varying responsibilities and perspectives who share a stake in facility operations.</p>
                            <p>A Green Team can be formal or informal but should always be multidisciplinary.</p>
                            <p>In Module 1 we covered:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>the triple bottom line of sustainability</li>
                                <li>the importance of leadership in the federal sector</li>
                                <li>the four fundamentals of sustainable facility management</li>
                                <li>integrating the four fundamentals into a holistic plan</li>
                                <li>the leadership role of the energy/facility manager in the team process</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In the next module we will cover ways to identify the best strategies to implement sustainable measures at your site.</p>
