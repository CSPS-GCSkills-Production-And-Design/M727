                            <h2>Module 2: Identifying Sustainability Opportunities â€“ Video Transcript</h2>
                            <p>In Module 2, we will look at energy and facility manager&rsquo;s typical tasks and responsibilities and how to broaden them to achieve multiple benefits with a single action. We will review the cyclical process of implementing sustainability and ways to use decision points as bridges to sustainable strategies.</p>
                            <p>The process for integrating sustainability measures into strategic goals can generally be summarized in four steps:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Evaluate current requirements and opportunities</li>
                                <li>Engage a team and measure operational performance</li>
                                <li>Develop, evaluate and implement sustainability measures</li>
                                <li>Revisit and revise goals and activities</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>&nbsp;These steps outline a cycle that should be followed to ensure that consistent improvements are being made.</p>
                            <p> Now, let&rsquo;s take a look at the first step in more detail.</p>
                            <p>The process of evaluating current requirements and opportunities begins by developing an understanding of a facility&rsquo;s sustainability requirements. Once an understanding has been established, the facility team can proceed to identify opportunities to expand sustainability efforts.</p>
                            <p>Meeting broad-based sustainability goals may or may not be part of your formal job description and job performance criteria. If not, you can still advance sustainability by taking advantage of key opportunities in the tasks you already perform to include broader sustainability measures. </p>
                            <p>Common opportunities to incorporate sustainability in your decision making include:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>undergoing a renovation or upgrade</li>
								<li>revising O&amp;M contracts</li>
								<li>replacing inefficient or aging equipment</li> 
								<li>scheduled preventative O&amp;M</li>
								<li>repurposing of office space</li>
							</ul>
                            <p>Let&rsquo;s go over some examples to see how these decision points can affect the overall sustainability of the building.</p>
                            <p>Undergoing a renovation or addition offers many opportunities for integrating and bundling low-cost sustainability measures. <br /> A common example is the construction of a new parking lot. </p>
                            <p>After an initial assessment, your team might identify multiple opportunities to improve the project&rsquo;s sustainability quotient such as:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>including clauses in the RFP that require recycled content</li>
								<li>concrete requiring highly efficient lighting</li>
								<li>including requirements for electric vehicle charging station</li>
							</ul>
							<p>In addition to meeting the needs of your facility&rsquo;s growing workforce, these measures will have other short and long term impacts such as:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>reducing waste by using recycled content products</li>
								<li>improving worker safety with better, more energy efficient lighting</li>
								<li>encouraging the purchase and use of electric vehicles</li>
							</ul>
                            <p>Revising O&amp;M contracts is a great opportunity to improve sustainability. A common example is the development of an RFP for a new contractor to clean your facilities.</p>
                            <p>This task presents several opportunities to add sustainability requirements such as:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>including clauses that require biobased, non-toxic cleaning products</li>
                                <li>incorporating sustainability performance metrics into vendor subcontracts</li>
                                <li>requiring ENERGY STAR-designated products</li>
                                <li>using local labor and small businesses</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The impacts of this decision are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>improving indoor environmental quality</li>
                                <li>improving workforce health and job satisfaction</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>A common equipment replacement project is the replacement of the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning system (HVAC).</p>
                            <p> The opportunities related to taking on such a project include:</p>
							<ul>
                            	<li>potential to downsize the new HVAC system based on calculated cost-savings from improving the building envelope</li>
								<li>potential to use dual heating and cooling technologies</li>
								<li>commissioning the new system and integrating existing systems for improved energy efficiency</li>
								<li>consider running system using clean energy</li>
							</ul>
                            <p>This decision point can affect sustainability in the following ways:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>improving the energy efficiency and energy use intensity of the building</li>
                                <li>improving ventilation and indoor air quality</li>
                                <li>increasing occupant comfort and productivity</li>
                                <li>reducing the need for HVAC repairs and downtime</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Your facility&rsquo;s preventative maintenance routine offers many opportunities to identify sustainability improvements.</p>
                            <p>Consider the following opportunities when performing commissioning activities for the HVAC and Building Automation Systems:</p> 
							<ul>
								<li>select a commissioning contractor with sustainability credentials and experience</li>
								<li>adjust building automation system to reflect actual occupancy</li>
								<li>establish an energy baseline and develop a benchmark to track progress</li>
								<li>develop energy conservation measures based on these results</li>
							</ul>
                            <p>Performing commissioning activities on the HVAC and Building Automation Systems can:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>improve occupant comfort during occupied office hours</li>
								<li>reduce manual overrides of BAS system which improves energy efficiency</li>
								<li>improve worker health and safety</li>
								<li>reduce GHG emissions</li>
							</ul>
                            <p>Repurposing office space offers many opportunities for sustainable upgrades. </p>
                            <p> For instance, if your team is charged with repurposing a floor in an office building, you should evaluate the benefits of:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>recycling old office furniture and building materials</li>
								<li>selecting new materials and furniture that is made from recycled content, biobased, and has low VOC finishes</li>
								<li>selecting partitions with reflective surfaces and lower heights to improve electric and day lighting potentials</li>
								<li>purchasing and installing efficient task lighting</li>
								<li>selecting low VOC, non-toxic, biobased paints</li>
							</ul>
                            <p> These measures can have a big impact, both in terms of reducing energy use and improving indoor environmental conditions for employees. The related impacts are:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>improved indoor air and environmental quality</li>
								<li>improved lighting efficiency</li>
								<li>improved plug loads</li>
							</ul>
                            <p>In Module 2 we reviewed:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>the typical tasks and responsibilities and how they can be broadened to include a sustainability component</li>
                                <li>we introduced the four-step process for integrating sustainability into a strategic plan</li>
                                <li>we covered key decision points in job tasks that can expand sustainability opportunities</li>
                            </ul>
							<p> In the next module we&rsquo;ll cover ways to benchmark your efforts, use software tools to chart your progress, and ways to engage your team in institutional change toward sustainable operations.</p>
