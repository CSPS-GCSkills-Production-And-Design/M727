							<p>So what is <abbr>O&M</abbr>? What do we mean by <abbr>O&M</abbr>?</p>
							<p>Here's a classic definition of what many people think is <abbr>O&M</abbr> is. Basically, just routine maintenance, and fixing things when they break.</p>
							<p>Classic definition: The process related to the performace of routine, preventative, predictive, scheduled, unscheduled and emergency maintenance. Includes operational factors such as scheduling, procedures and work/systems control.</p>
							<p>Today we'd like to propose a modern definition of <abbr>O&M</abbr>, a view that operations and maintenance is not just operations, and not just maintenance, but really, inclusive of five key areas: Operations, maintenance, engineering, training, and administration. All of these areas are key to a successful <abbr>O&M</abbr> program.</p>
							<p>Modern definition: The coordinated integration of the operations, maintenance, engineering support, training, and administrative areas (<abbr>OMETA</abbr>) of any process in order to maintain and/or increase the efficiency, reliability, and safety of the process.</p>
							<p>We'll talk about how these fit together a little bit later, and how we can evaluate each of these areas to determine whether or not they're contributing as they should to the <abbr>O&M</abbr> program.</p>
							<p>Many surveys on <abbr>O&M</abbr> have been performed throughout the years, and the findings show there are several <abbr>O&M</abbr> issues that are commonly seen. These issues include: operating equipment in manual override and incorrectly adjusted equipment.</p>
							<p>There are also frequently leaks in various systems, faulty control systems, and problems with <abbr>HVAC</abbr> equipment. None of these issues are unusual, and I'm sure that many of you have encountered one or more of these problems at your facilities. These problem areas offer a great opportunity for energy savings.</p>
							<p>In fact, one <abbr>US</abbr>-based survey indicated that energy savings of 5 per cent to 20 per cent are common, and that most of the fixes are low cost or no cost.</p>
							<p>Simple <abbr>O&M</abbr>-type repairs that can turn around and save some major dollars.</p>
							<p>Through this course, we’d like to promote an “<abbr>O&M</abbr> first” philosophy.</p>
							<p>Often at our facilities, <abbr>O&M</abbr> is not put first, but last. Frequently, the first place that management looks to cut costs is in the <abbr>O&M</abbr> budgets. But that's not the way to solve problems, save energy or to save money in the long-term.</p>
							<p>The benefit of putting <abbr>O&M</abbr> first is reducing energy consumption, as well as reducing unscheduled equipment repairs or replacements. We’ll discuss that more later, when we discuss reactive, preventive, and predictive maintenance.</p>
							<p>If we place <abbr>O&M</abbr> first, we increase the reliability of our facilities. We’ll also reduce capital cost, because if things aren't breaking, we don't have to replace them. We're going to try to get the design life out of the equipment that we put in a facility and ensure that other energy conservation technologies achieve their expected cost savings.</p>
							<p>We validate and verify that the new equipment that we put in and our measures actually save and conserve energy. And if things aren't breaking all the time not only is safety going to be improved, but also operations and maintenance staff morale.</p>
							<p>So, what are the barriers to putting <abbr>O&M</abbr> first? Well, we touched on a couple of the biggest barriers already, starting with the budget. The budget is obviously a big barrier and one that's hard to overcome. Management may not want to pay for <abbr>O&M</abbr>, because they might not understand the importance of it. It’s important to educate management on the benefits of putting <abbr>O&M</abbr> first.</p>
							<p>There could also be limited staff and a lack of training. Inadequate diagnostic equipment can also exist in some cases, depending on what type of <abbr>O&M</abbr> activities needs to be performed. Missing technical documents can be a big barrier as well.</p>
							<p>In many facilities, especially older ones, it's hard to get documentation related to the facility, either the equipment itself or piping and instrument drawings. Documentation may have been neglected for many years.</p>
							<p>If you are doing a commissioning-type activity, this is an opportunity to start from ground level in putting the documentation together. This includes documentation related to the <abbr>O&M</abbr> program, how the facility should operate, the components within the facility, the diagrams and everything else associated with that facility. That way you can access those documents in 15 to 20 years to determine whether or not the components and the systems within that building are operating correctly. Commissioning is the time to do this, not later.</p>
							<p>There’s also often inadequate building and equipment metering. Without adequate metering it's hard to tell whether or not a piece of equipment is operating properly. It’s hard to tell if you're saving dollars in steam or fuel, unless you have the information at hand to tell you. And this information is generally gleaned from metering.</p>
							<p>A lack of management commitment, again, we'll talk about this more later, but it's the jobs of the ones involved in <abbr>O&M</abbr>, to train management on how important <abbr>O&M</abbr> is.</p>
							<p>Another barrier might be poor morale, both from your operations staff, your maintenance staff, and even your management, because the building is in a state of disrepair and things have been breaking for a long time.</p>
							<p>So, how do you sell <abbr>O&M</abbr> to management? You have to address the concerns that they have.</p>
							<p>They may be concerned that the program won't succeed. Or they could be concerned that costs are too high and that they don't have the money.</p>
							<p>They may be concerned that the changes required are too technical. Their confidence level could be affected by their limited understanding of the technologies or perhaps just of <abbr>O&M</abbr> fundamentals. They could also be concerned that they will see no personal benefit or that human resource problems might exist.</p>
							<p>So, you have to understand the decision makers and you have to understand the competition. Who else is fighting for the funding that you want to put towards <abbr>O&M</abbr>? You need to speak the language of the decision makers and have a strong understanding of the project’s economics, return on investment and life cycle costs. Educate yourself to help educate those who make the decisions on the budget.</p>
							<p>So, how do you get the program off the ground? Well, you should start small and don't bite off more than you can chew. Start with a small piece of equipment that has high opportunity for success, something that has an opportunity to save money from either an energy standpoint, or from saving on replacement costs.</p>
							<p>Keep accurate records. Record the time and cost spent on the project, the maintenance cost savings, and maintenance cost avoidance. These are just a few of the type of things that you want to maintain during this process. If you have adequate metering installed, you can meter fuel costs associated with whichever piece of equipment or system that you've selected.</p>
							<p>You might be able to record steam flow, temperatures, pressures, or more that can substantiate your efforts.</p>
							<p>Keeping accurate records can help prove the importance of <abbr>O&M</abbr> to management.</p>
							<p>And then show the data, share the results to your management.</p>
