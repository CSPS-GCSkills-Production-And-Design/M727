         <p begin="2" end="5">Hi everyone and welcome to Natural Resources Canada's eTraining module</p>
<p begin="5.651" end="8.651">on Operations, Maintenance, and Commissioning.</p>
<p begin="10.94" end="14.61">This course has been adapted from the US Department of Energy's Federal Energy Management</p>
<p begin="14.81" end="18.046">Program training material on implementing deep retrofits.</p>
<p begin="18.246" end="22.711">This training is being delivered through the Natural Resources Canada Greening Government Services,</p>
<p begin="22.911" end="27.331">to help federal departments and agencies plan and implement projects that reduce the energy use</p>
<p begin="27.531" end="33.045">and greenhouse gas emissions in their buildings, laboratories, other facilities and vehicle fleets.</p>
<p begin="33.245" end="38.37">Over the years, Natural Resources Canada has been successfully developing comprehensive methodologies,</p>
<p begin="38.57" end="42.69">practices and tools to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions</p>
<p begin="42.89" end="46.176">for the private and public sectors, including the federal government.</p>
<p begin="46.376" end="52.005">Since 1991, NRCan has provided enhanced technical support to Government of Canada organizations</p>
<p begin="52.205" end="57.685">seeking ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction actions from their building and fleet operations.</p>
<p begin="57.885" end="62.724">This training will support federal organizations to meet their commitments and lead by example.</p>
<p begin="62.924" end="68.936">Federal facilities have committed to reducing emissions from their operations by 40% below 2005 levels</p>
<p begin="69.136" end="77.136">by 2030 and by 80% by 2050, as outlined in the 2016-19 Federal Sustainable Development Strategy.</p>
<p begin="77.218" end="83.22">This initiative also supports the commitment by Canada's federal, provincial and territorial first ministers</p>
<p begin="83.42" end="87.972">to scale up efforts to transition to highly efficient buildings and zero-emission vehicle fleets,</p>
<p begin="88.172" end="92.614">as specified in the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change.</p>
<p begin="92.814" end="100.04">I'd like to start by covering our objectives for today. Upon completion of this seminar, you will be able to:</p>
<p begin="100.24" end="102.626">- give an up-to-date definition of operations and maintenance;</p>
<p begin="102.826" end="105.795">- explain the relationship of O&amp;M on commissioning;</p>
<p begin="105.995" end="109.417">- discuss the benefits of a well-run O&amp;M program;</p>
<p begin="109.617" end="114.35">- explain some of the common barriers to O&amp;M, and how to overcome those barriers;</p>
<p begin="114.55" end="118.149">- list five performance measures for an effective O&amp;M program;</p>
<p begin="118.349" end="122.869">- explain the term, "OMETA," in terms of a complete O&amp;M program;</p>
<p begin="123.069" end="128.147">- explain life cycle implications in O&amp;M from new component design to replacement;</p>
<p begin="128.347" end="135.678">- discuss the benefits of each of these types of maintenance: reactive, preventative, predictive, and reliability-centered;</p>
<p begin="135.878" end="140.612">- and locate the resources to support you as you develop your O&amp;M programs.</p>
<p begin="140.812" end="144.584">The course is broken into the following segments.</p>
