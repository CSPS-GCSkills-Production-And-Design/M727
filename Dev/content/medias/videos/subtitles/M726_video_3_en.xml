         <p begin="0.2" end="1.05">So what is O&amp;M?</p>
<p begin="1.25" end="3.023">What do we mean by O&amp;M?</p>
<p begin="4.223" end="7.223">Here's a classic definition of what many people think is O&amp;M is.</p>
<p begin="8.09" end="11.09">Basically, just routine maintenance, and fixing things when they break.</p>
<p begin="15.66" end="18.66">Today we'd like to propose a modern definition of O&amp;M,</p>
<p begin="18.84" end="22.14">a view that operations and maintenance is not just operations,</p>
<p begin="22.41" end="25.41">and not just maintenance, but really, inclusive of five key areas:</p>
<p begin="25.92" end="30.32">Operations, maintenance, engineering, training, and administration.</p>
<p begin="31.62" end="34.62">All of these areas are key to a successful O&amp;M program.</p>
<p begin="35.22" end="38.22">We'll talk about how these fit together a little bit later,</p>
<p begin="38.33" end="40.33">and how we can evaluate each of these areas to determine</p>
<p begin="40.43" end="44.43">whether or not they're contributing as they should to the O&amp;M program.</p>
<p begin="45.34" end="50.34">Many surveys on O&amp;M have been performed throughout the years, and the findings show there are several</p>
<p begin="50.38" end="56.38">O&amp;M issues that are commonly seen. These issues seen include: operating equipment in manual override</p>
<p begin="56.42" end="62.22">and incorrectly adjusted equipment. There are also frequently leaks in various systems, faulty control</p>
<p begin="62.42" end="68.42">systems, and problems with HVAC equipment. None of these issues are unusual, and I'm sure that many of you</p>
<p begin="68.93" end="70.93">have encountered one or more of these problems at your facilities.</p>
<p begin="71.55" end="75.45">These problem areas offer a great opportunity for energy savings.</p>
<p begin="76.64" end="82.64">In fact, one US-based survey indicated that energy savings of 5 per cent to 20 per cent are common,</p>
<p begin="82.72" end="85.72">and that most of the fixes are low cost or no cost.</p>
<p begin="86.9" end="90.9">There are some simple O&amp;M-type repairs that can turn around and save some major dollars.</p>
<p begin="91.49" end="95.49">Through this course, we'd like to promote an "O&amp;M first" philosophy.</p>
<p begin="96.13" end="102.13">Often at our facilities, O&amp;M is not put first, but last. Frequently, the first place that management looks</p>
<p begin="102.14" end="107.14">to cut costs is in the O&amp;M budgets. But that's not the way to solve problems, save energy or to</p>
<p begin="107.71" end="109.71">save money in the long-term.</p>
<p begin="109.73" end="114.73">The benefit of putting O&amp;M first is reducing energy consumption, as well as reducing unscheduled</p>
<p begin="114.99" end="119.99">equipment repairs or replacements. We'll discuss that more later, when we discuss reactive,</p>
<p begin="120.29" end="122.29">preventive, and predictive maintenance.</p>
<p begin="122.69" end="128.76">If we place O&amp;M first, we increase the reliability of our facilities. We'll also reduce capital cost, because if</p>
<p begin="128.96" end="134.2">if things aren't breaking, we don't have to replace them. We're going to try to get the design life out of the</p>
<p begin="134.4" end="139.4">equipment that we put in a facility and ensure that other energy conservation technologies</p>
<p begin="139.62" end="141.37">achieve their expected cost savings.</p>
<p begin="141.57" end="145.4">We validate and verify that the new equipment that we put in and our measures</p>
<p begin="145.6" end="150.6">actually save and conserve energy. And if things aren't breaking all the time</p>
<p begin="151.14" end="155.14">not only is safety going to be improved, but also operations and maintenance staff morale.</p>
<p begin="156.85" end="161.85">So, what are the barriers to putting O&amp;M first? Well, we touched on a couple of the biggest barriers already,</p>
<p begin="162.42" end="167.42">starting with the budget. The budget is obviously a big barrier and one that's hard to overcome.</p>
<p begin="168.11" end="173.11">Management may not want to pay for O&amp;M, because they might not understand the importance of it.</p>
<p begin="173.65" end="177.65">It's important to educate management on the benefits of putting O&amp;M first.</p>
<p begin="178.84" end="183.56">There could also be limited staff and a lack of training. Inadequate diagnostic equipment</p>
<p begin="183.76" end="188.76">can also exist in some cases, depending on what type of O&amp;M activities needs to be performed.</p>
<p begin="189.45" end="195.45">Missing technical documents can be a big barrier as well. In many facilities, especially older ones,</p>
<p begin="196.07" end="200.86">it's hard to get documentation related to the facility, either the equipment itself or piping and</p>
<p begin="201.06" end="206.55">instrument drawings. Documentation may have been neglected for many years.</p>
<p begin="206.75" end="212.75">If you are doing a commissioning-type activity, this is an opportunity to start from ground level in putting</p>
<p begin="212.95" end="218.63">the documentation together. This includes documentation related to the O&amp;M program, how the</p>
<p begin="218.64" end="222.29">facility should operate, the components within the facility, the diagrams and</p>
<p begin="222.49" end="228.51">everything else associated with that facility. That way you can access those documents in 15 to 20 years to</p>
<p begin="228.71" end="232.86">determine whether or not the components and the systems within that building</p>
<p begin="233.06" end="237.06">are operating correctly. Commissioning is the time to do this, not later.</p>
<p begin="238.27" end="243.25">There's also often inadequate building and equipment metering. Without adequate metering it's hard</p>
<p begin="243.45" end="246.45">to tell whether or not a piece of equipment is operating properly.</p>
<p begin="246.67" end="252.67">It's hard to tell if you're saving dollars in steam or fuel, unless you have the information at hand to tell you.</p>
<p begin="253.19" end="259.09">And this information is generally gleaned from metering. With a lack of management commitment it's the jobs</p>
<p begin="259.26" end="263.26">of the ones involved in O&amp;M, to train management on how important O&amp;M is.</p>
<p begin="264.04" end="268.04">Another barrier might be poor morale, both from your operations staff, your maintenance staff,</p>
<p begin="268.53" end="271.91">and even your management, because the building is in a state of disrepair and</p>
<p begin="272.11" end="274.11">things have been breaking for a long time.</p>
<p begin="274.3" end="279.3">So, how do you sell O&amp;M to management? You have to address the concerns that they have.</p>
<p begin="280.22" end="284.22">They may be concerned that the program won't succeed. Or they could be concerned that</p>
<p begin="284.45" end="286.45">costs are too high and that they don't have the money.</p>
<p begin="287.63" end="291.63">They may be concerned that the changes required are too technical. Their confidence level could</p>
<p begin="292.24" end="297.24">be affected by their limited understanding of the technologies or perhaps just of O&amp;M fundamentals.</p>
<p begin="297.67" end="301.67">They could also be concerned that they will see no personal benefit or</p>
<p begin="301.87" end="303.47">that human resource problems might exist.</p>
<p begin="304.77" end="309.57">So, you have to understand the decision makers and you have to understand the competition.</p>
<p begin="309.6" end="313.95">Who else is fighting for the funding that you want to put towards O&amp;M? You need to speak the language of</p>
<p begin="314.15" end="318.25">the decision makers and have a strong understanding of the project's economics,</p>
<p begin="318.45" end="323.45">return on investment and life cycle costs. Educate yourself to help educate</p>
<p begin="323.57" end="325.27">those who make the decisions on the budget.</p>
<p begin="326.65" end="332.64">So, how do you get the program off the ground? Well, you should start small and don't bite off</p>
<p begin="332.84" end="337.84">more than you can chew. Start with a small piece of equipment that has high opportunity for success,</p>
<p begin="338" end="341">something that has an opportunity to save money from either an energy standpoint,</p>
<p begin="341.69" end="347.69">or from saving on replacement costs. Keep accurate records. Record the time and cost spent on the</p>
<p begin="348.06" end="351.17">project, the maintenance cost savings, and maintenance cost avoidance.</p>
<p begin="352.17" end="355.67">These are just a few of the type of things that you want to maintain during this process.</p>
<p begin="356.82" end="360.82">If you have adequate metering installed, you can meter fuel costs associated with whichever piece</p>
<p begin="361.44" end="365.63">of equipment or system that you've selected. You might be able to record steam flow, temperatures,</p>
<p begin="365.83" end="368.73">pressures, or more that can substantiate your efforts.</p>
<p begin="369.15" end="373.15">Keeping accurate records can help prove the importance of O&amp;M to management.</p>
<p begin="373.94" end="376.34">And then show the data, share the results to your management.</p>
