                            <p>In this module will discuss best practices for translating your baseline and benchmarking data sets into clear metric-based sustainability goals. From there, your team will be well informed to select and implement sustainability measures that meet your facility&rsquo;s specific needs and provide opportunities for continuous improvement.</p>
                            <p>The slides that follow will explain methods for analyzing data and setting sustainability goals, evaluating different sustainability measures and developing a sustainability action plan.</p>
                            <p>The data produced by benchmarking will provide your team with information to formulate operational performance plans for each of the four fundamentals individually and in combination.</p>
                            <p> As a next step, analyze the benchmarking data to determine trends in resource consumption and to estimate the potential for improvements.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;Benchmarking data can be used to:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Rank facilities by performance in different compliance areas;</li>
                                <li>Identify high performing facilities for replicable practices;</li>
                                <li>Prioritize poor performing facilities for immediate improvement; and</li>
                                <li>Identify opportunities to save resources and costs.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Within Portfolio Manager, it is possible to generate progress reports on individual facilities and entire portfolios.</p>
                            <p>The value of benchmarking data becomes apparent once its analyzed for resource use patterns and trends. Your team will need to determine which combination of analysis methods best fit your facility&rsquo;s needs. </p>
                            <p> Analyzing quantitative data will allow you to compare consumption and cost data across utilities over time and will reveal trends. This knowledge is critical to incorporate into strategic planning and action.
                                <br /> Use profiles: identify energy consumption peaks and valleys and determines how they relate to operations or key events</p>
                            <p> Performance comparisons: compare the use and performance data of similar facilities within your campus or across your department.
                                <br /> Financial impact assessments: identify areas of high-cost resource use</p>
                            <p> Analyzing qualitative data will review feedback from building occupants and incorporate preferences and behaviors into sustainable organizational values and procedures. This will influence outcomes and reveal sustainable choices. It will also enable continual improvement and ensure adaptive management.</p>
                            <p> Interviews can be used to document opinions, experiences, and best practices from building staff, occupants, and others about how building systems are used.</p>
                            <p> Policies and procedure reviews examine how organizational policies and operating procedures positively or negatively impact resource use.</p>
                            <p>How do you set sustainability goals?</p>
                            <p>The best way is to start with accurate benchmarking data. With accurate data, the Sustainability Team can set actionable performance goals that take into account:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Benchmarking results</li>
                                <li>Federal requirements and mandates</li>
                                <li>Departmental strategic sustainability goals</li>
                                <li>Facility priorities based on the results from technical assessments and audits; and</li>
                                <li>Performance goals of similar facilities</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>It is helpful to create a table of sustainability performance goals in order to have one list incorporating all potential goals. This table will make it easier to share progress and status updates with external stakeholders.</p>
                            <p>To set meaningful goals with buy-in, now is a good time to actively engage the team, schedule a series of meetings to review data analysis results, discuss performance gaps, and brainstorm improvement strategies. </p>
                            <p> First, establish a Vision Statement to articulate exactly how sustainability helps the facility and department meet its mission.</p>
                            <p> Next, develop a set of Sustainability Priorities to identify specific focus areas or high-priority items that are unique to your site. </p>
                            <p> Finally, link Performance Goals to priorities with clear metrics that correspond to each priority.</p>
                            <p>When you establish a clear vision, your objectives should naturally flow out of this vision. Then, your criteria emerge from those objectives. Next, you can benchmark against that criteria. And finally, you can establish methods to track results.</p>
                            <p>Work with your team to develop effective strategies and track progress using SMART goals that are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Specific</li>
                                <li>Measurable and monitored</li>
                                <li>Achievable</li>
                                <li>Realistic, and</li>
                                <li>Time-bound</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Common ways to express sustainability goals include:
                                <br /> Defined reduction, where goals are expressed in terms of a specific quantity or percentage decrease, such as a 10 percent water reduction or an annual energy reduction of 300 kWh.</p>
                            <p> Best-in-class: where goals are expressed as a certain level of performance, compared to an established benchmark.</p>
                            <p> Efficiency improvement: where goals are expressed as a function of reducing the resource-use intensity of a specific performance indicator.</p>
                            <p> Environmental Improvement: where goals are translated as savings presented into pollution prevention targets or materials avoidance units.</p>
                            <p> Additionally, your facility may find it useful to establish:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Threshold goals: where goals are expressed as a minimum acceptable level of performance, and</li>
                                <li>Stretch goals: where goals are expressed as levels beyond typical targets, to create an incentive for greater achievement.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>With Performance Goals firmly established, your team can now develop an integrated set of Sustainability Measures.
                                <br /> Sustainability measures can include projects, policies, and procedures. In many cases, your team will want to strategically combine several sustainability measures to achieve a goal. </p>
                            <p> Take advantage upfront of the &ldquo;low hanging fruit,&rdquo; or no-cost/low-cost measures, such as:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Repairs and scheduled preventative maintenance to building systems</li>
                                <li>Policy revisions to Operations &amp; Maintenance, purchasing, and property management policies, or</li>
                                <li>Efficiency upgrades for lighting and water fixtures</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Occupant behaviour changes are another way to improve the sustainability of your facility.
                                <br /> Building occupants behavior has been shown to directly impact up to 30% of facility resource use.</p>
                            <p>Include sustainability measures that strategically target the behavior of building users and operators.
                                <br /> Training for building operators, including property managers, O&amp;M staff, and cleaning crew can have big pay-offs.
                                <br /> Educating occupants about resource consumption can yield big savings, examples of beneficial behavior include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Turning off lights and shared technology when not in use</li>
                                <li>Using double-sided printing options throughout the building</li>
                                <li>Reducing plug loads by unplugging equipment at the &ldquo;strip&rdquo;</li>
                                <li>Taking stairs for short trips between floors</li>
                                <li>Using water from the tap or water cooler instead of bottled water</li>
                                <li>Ride sharing or using public transit</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>After exploring low hanging fruit and occupant behaviour changes, consider integrating sustainability measures into capital improvements projects:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ensure that all equipment is tuned-up, commissioned, calibrated, and operating efficiently,</li>
                                <li>Assess current needs and right-size replacement equipment,</li>
                                <li>Specify the most energy efficient components and models when replacing equipment, and</li>
                                <li>Integrate sustainable design features into the project, such as performance-oriented siting and landscaping, daylighting, recycled content, design for disassembly, and passive heating and cooling.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Measures that are life cycle cost-effective have estimated savings that exceed the estimated costs over their lifespan. In economic terms, a building design is deemed to be cost-effective if it results in benefits equal to those of alternative designs and has a lower whole life cost, or total cost of ownership.
                                <br /> For your team&rsquo;s first project, it is important to identify simple actions that can be made to show quick progress or payback.</p>
                            <p>Let&rsquo;s explore some Energy Efficiency measures that can lead to a more sustainable and enjoyable office environment.
                                <br /> One example is to align daylight harvesting with space function to reduce the need for electric lighting and heating and cooling loads. </p>
                            <p> There are several ways to implement this measure, for example:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>By installing light shelves to increase reflectivity at window openings to increase daylight penetration.</li>
                                <li>Running light tubes through ceilings to supply more natural light from the roof.</li>
                                <li>Installing window shadings and glare filters to reduce glare on workstations.</li>
                                <li>Lowering workstation walls to 1 meter to provide privacy while transmitting light across office space.</li>
                                <li>Maximizing access to outdoor views and light to increase occupant comfort, satisfaction and productivity and,</li>
                                <li>Providing controls for window shades to empower occupants to manage the glare and heat admitted into the workspace</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>HVAC systems typically comprise the largest energy-using component of any building or facility and have the greatest energy savings opportunity.</p>
                            <p>In new buildings, design buildings to site HVAC systems towards the center of the building to keep conditioned air near workspaces and avoid loss through exterior walls. In existing buildings, look for component replacements to optimize performance of the overall system.</p>
                            <p>Actions that can be taken to capitalize on this opportunity include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Upgrading insulation, building envelope sealants, and windows to downsize the HVAC system and lower energy consumption.</li>
                                <li>Increasing ventilation rates to replace contaminated air with filtered air from the outdoors to improve work performance and occupant health.</li>
                                <li>Taking advantage of opportunities to re-commission or retro-commission HVAC systems to ensure they are operating using ASHRAE-90.1 recommended settings, and</li>
                                <li>Where possible, display HVAC and other resource-using system information in common areas to educate building occupants.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Water efficiency measures are another way of improving the sustainability of a facility.
                                <br /> Rainwater harvesting systems capture and reuse non-potable on-site water that can be used for landscape irrigation and reduce potable water and non-potable water consumption. </p>
                            <p> This measure presents the following benefits related to improved sustainability:<ul>
                                    <li>Green roofs substantially reduce heat loss through the roof membrane.</li>
                                    <li>Stormwater collection and retention systems reduce the energy required to pump and process water at the municipal level.</li>
                                    <li>Wetland plant species can enhance water quality through bio-digestion of pollutants.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p> For human health reasons, grey water and stormwater harvesting systems must comply with local building codes.</p>
                            <p>Restrooms present opportunities to improve the water efficiency of a facility.
                                <p> Here are some measures to consider when looking to improve the water efficiency of restrooms:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Implement a fixture replacement and retrofit policy with technologically advanced water-efficient alternatives to conventional fixtures.</li>
                                    <li> Use waterless urinals where appropriate and convert faucets to automated and sensor-driven fixtures for greater efficiency.</li>
                                    <li> Use condensate from the HVAC unit as a non-potable water source for flushing toilets and urinals.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>Set up a leak detection program to provide occupants an easy way to report leaks.</p>
                            <p> The benefits of implementing sustainability measures in restrooms include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Automated electric hand dryers eliminate the need for paper products.</li>
                                <li> Waste heat from HVAC systems can be used to pre-heat domestic hot water.</li>
                                <li> Automated sensor faucets limit the passing of germs from occupant to occupant.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Selecting the right renovation materials can help contribute to a more sustainable operation.
                                <br /> Procure durable, environmentally preferable, and long-lasting materials specified from local suppliers and vendors when undergoing a major renovation. </p>
                            <p> Actions related to this efficiency measure include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Selecting locally sourced materials that require less transportation and support local economies.</li>
                                <li> Specify low-emitting materials to create healthy indoor air quality.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Composting organic waste is another measure for improving the operational sustainability of a facility. Composting appropriately eliminates waste and reuses natural materials as nutrients for useful landscaping purposes.
                                <p> The benefits associated with composting are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Improved water retention which leads to a reduced need for irrigation on gardens and grounds.</li>
                                    <li> And energy and water savings resulting from reducing potable water used for garbage disposal.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The use of environmentally-friendly cleaning products within a facility contributes to a healthier indoor environment.
                                    <br /> Facilities should establish a green cleaning policy for the purchase and use of non-toxic, low or no-VOC, and biobased cleaning equipment and materials. Bio-based products are commercial or industrial products that are significantly composed of biological products, renewable agricultural materials (including plant, animal, and marine materials) or forestry materials.</p>
                                <p> Green cleaning products used in restrooms and food preparation areas keep toxins from entering the facility&rsquo;s water and sewer discharge.
                                    <br /> Non-toxic and bio-based cleaning products provide a safe and healthy work environment.</p>
                                <p>An example of an Indoor Environmental Quality measure is the use of Indoor plants.
                                    <br /> Indoor plants can improve air quality, create more comfortable spaces, and improve workplace satisfaction. Plants can filter air, sequester carbon, produce oxygen, and absorb chemicals such as benzene, formaldehyde, or trichloroethylene. </p>
                                <p> Consider &ldquo;Green&rdquo; walls to create inspirational or contemplative interior spaces, humidify the air, and improve indoor air quality.</p>
                                <p>Interior acoustics can play a big role in improving the indoor environmental quality of an office.</p>
                                <p>Good interior acoustics are particularly important to employees working in open spaces. Acoustic interior panels made of environmentally preferable materials are a great option for reducing noise levels without affecting the indoor environmental quality.
                                    <br /> Acoustic interior panels made of translucent material block sound while allowing daylight or general light to penetrate into a space which can lessen the need for electric lighting.</p>
                                <p> Actions for improving interior acoustics include:
                                    <br /> Using materials such as acoustic ceiling tiles and carpeting to absorb sound and using sound blocking strategies such as space design and furniture placement to control noise-generating sources.</p>
                                <p>The Sustainability Action Plan is critical to cement your facility&rsquo;s commitment to sustainability and to maintain important momentum.</p>
                                <p>The Best Practices for developing a Sustainability Action Plan include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Ask senior management to host an official launch event,</li>
                                    <li>Establish clear roles for team members,</li>
                                    <li>Ensure project expectations mesh with team members&rsquo; availability and duties,</li>
                                    <li>Keep team members consistently up to date and seek their input,</li>
                                    <li>Schedule regular check-ins, and</li>
                                    <li>Set achievable timelines for deliverables and checkpoints</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Summarizing benchmarking and goal-setting results in an Action Plan documents your team&rsquo;s progress and presents it effectively to management, staff, or other audiences. Consider updating your Action Plan annually. </p>
                                <p> Ensure your Action Plan covers the critical elements like:&nbsp;</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Sustainability Program Intent,</li>
                                    <li>Sustainability Vision, Priorities, and Performance Goals, and</li>
                                    <li>Current Benchmarking Results relative to the Baseline</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Include technical steps and targets related to each Performance Goal, such as:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Sustainability Measures that specify actions and policies for meeting each goal,</li>
                                    <li>Key Performance Metrics that identify units used for tracking progress,</li>
                                    <li>An Implementation Timeline that details a timeframe for carrying out each measure,</li>
                                    <li>Team Roles and Resources related to each measure, and</li>
                                    <li>Outreach and Communication Plans to influence occupant behavior and garner support</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Also, include a Measurement and Reporting Schedule to document progress.</p>
                                <p>In Module 4 we reviewed Benchmarking and Analyzing data to set sustainability goals, Selecting and evaluating Sustainability Measures and Developing a sustainability action plan.</p>
                                <p> In the next module, we will discuss the importance of sustainability as a cycle for continuous improvement.</p>
