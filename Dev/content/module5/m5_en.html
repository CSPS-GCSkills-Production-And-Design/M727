                            <h2>The Component Life Cycle - Video transcript</h2>
							<p>Before getting into maintenance programs, we’re going to go over the component life cycle.</p>
							<p>What is the component life cycle? It's something we don't think about very often, but it's why we do business, it's why we operate the way we operate. It's why we maintain components.</p>
							<p>Here's a very rudimentary life cycle. Just a simple diagram to get the point across.</p>
							<p>At some point in time, there is a new component. The designer intended that component to operate in a specific operational environment, with a specific temperature, pressure, clearances, vibration, etc.</p>
							<p>The component gets installed, and hopefully, the design basis is used when the component is operated. Hopefully it’s operated within the envelope that the designer intended it to be.</p>
							<p>The designer recognizes, however, that no component, no system lasts forever. It's going to undergo some level of degradation. If the component is maintained correctly, it will maintain the rate of degradation that the designer intended.</p>
							<p>There are some other things that have to be done to maintain that degradation rate. We have to perform various maintenance activities that the designer intended to be performed on that component. Similar to the design of your car, which intended you to change oil every so often, the designer of most components intended you to perform some level of preventive maintenance on a regular basis.</p>
							<p>There's also repair refurbishment. Wheel bearings don’t last forever. Fan belts don’t last forever. So, we have to refurbish or repair various parts of most components we talk about to maintain that component, and get the design life out of that component.</p>
							<p>At some point in time, at the end of the design life, it will no longer be cost-effective to refurbish the component. It's worn out. At that point in time, the component is replaced and the cycle starts all over. </p>
							<p>But what happens when things go wrong, if we don't operate, or maintain that component? Well, we'll shorten its life.</p>
							<p>We could use a component in an incorrect application and induce stressors in that component that wouldn’t normally exist. We could operate that component in an off-normal operation, outside the envelope that the designer originally intended.</p>
							<p>We could perform maintenance on that component, there could be improper maintenance, or we just don't do the maintenance that’s required. All these things can add up and change the rate of degradation that and component experiences and leads to premature failure.</p>
							<p>Now we’re going to talk about maintenance programs and practices. What are maintenance programs? And what are maintenance practices? Well, basically, maintenance is trying to minimize the degradation of a piece of equipment and extend its life to design, to what the designer intended.</p>
							<p>There are various maintenance program options. There’s reactive maintenance, preventive maintenance, predictive maintenance, and reliability-centered maintenance. And we'll talk about each of these in a little bit more detail.</p>
							<p>Reactive maintenance is the predominant method of maintenance, but does very little to get the life out of a component that the designer intended. Reactive maintenance, basically just says: "Run it until it breaks." It's been the typical mode of maintenance for not only the federal sector, but also the private sector, for quite some time.</p>
							<p>Reactive maintenance advantages. This should really be "Perceived advantages". If nothing’s breaking and there aren’t any major issues at the facility, reactive maintenance could be perceived as an advantage, since it costs less, both in terms of staff and capital costs.</p>
							<p>In reality, it's the opposite. Reactive maintenance programs lead to unplanned downtime. You're not going to have a reliable building. You could also see increased labor costs if something breaks down outside of regular work hours.</p>
							<p>Repair and replacement costs. There are obvious costs associated with the component in replacing or repairing it. Also, there are going to be costs associated with trying to maintain parts inventory on stock to keep all the components working.</p>
							<p>With secondary equipment damage, when something breaks, it often causes something else to break. As an example, cars generally have some type of timing belt, or timing gear. In many cars, this only costs a few hundred dollars to replace, and should be done, say, every 100,000, 150,000 km, depending on the car manufacturer's recommendations. But if we wait, in some cases, this belt can fail and cause secondary damage of the engine, and which may cost many thousands of dollars.</p>
							<p>It's a case of the primary component, the belt or the chain, a breakage causes secondary damage and inefficient use of staff resources. Reactive maintenance is just inefficient.</p>
							<p>The next maintenance option we have is a preventive maintenance program. What we are trying to do with any preventive maintenance program, other than reactive maintenance, is to extend the life of a component to its design life, while trying to maintain energy efficiency, and optimum operation of our plant.</p>
							<p>Preventive maintenance type tasks that we talked about in the design or life cycle design are things like changing oil, and replacing filters, and greasing bearings, these types of things.</p>
							<p>And these tasks are done periodically. Their maintenance period can be marked by calendar days, run time, or parts produced. These maintenance activities are not performed based on the actual condition of the machine. They're performed through recommendations and engineering experience.</p>
							<p>These maintenance activities are useful against degradation type modes of wear, fatigue, and corrosion, and you might think of it is as analogous to the automobile schedule of maintenance. We all know that when we purchase our new car, and it's warrantied for 50,000 km, or 100,000 km and that warranty is contingent on performing preventive maintenance. When you open the manual, it will have a maintenance schedule that says, "Every 5,000 km do this, or 10,000 km do this,” The car manufacturer is confident that if you perform the preventive maintenance tasks, and operate the car correctly, the warranty is going to last and you’ll get the design life out of the vehicle.</p>
							<p>It's the same way at our facilities. If preventive maintenance is performed correctly, it extends the life of the components and the system, and saves money due to energy consumption.</p>
							<p>What are the advantages of Preventive Maintenance? We’ve already touched on a few. It’s cost effective. It can extend the life of our components. It helps save energy, increases the component life cycle, and increases the reliability of the plant. Also, preventive maintenance is flexible; it's flexible in that you might schedule a task for one timeframe, but I still have flexibility to move it. If I change oil every 5,000 km, in one case I might change it every 4,800 km, or I might wait until 5,500km before I change the oil. It does have flexibility.</p>
							<p>There are some disadvantages, though, especially compared to predictive maintenance. You're still likely to have failures. Preventive maintenance won't take care of and mitigate all the failures you might experience within a plant or a plant's equipment. It's labor-intensive and if things aren't breaking, you probably don't need someone to go around and do preventive maintenance in the near-term.  But in the longer-term it does pay-off.</p>
							<p>Another disadvantage is the performance of unneeded maintenance. In some cases, if maintenance is being done based on a schedule, and not based on the actual condition or the machine, we can perform unneeded maintenance. We might change a belt on a fan that doesn't need changing or change oil in a large oil reservoir that doesn't need be changed it may just be fine chemically.</p>
							<p>There can be incidental damage to components through poor maintenance practices. Many of us have seen the bathtub curve related to the probability of an equipment failure shortly after a major maintenance overhaul. We can, in fact, through preventive maintenance, actually cause damage to our components. This is where some of the other key entities and key elements that I spoke of earlier in <abbr>OMETA</abbr>, can assist, and are very important. Do we have adequate documentation to support the maintenance staff during this overhaul or during this maintenance activity? Do they have the proper manufacturers' guidelines? Are they properly trained? Do they know what to do and how to do it?</p>
							<p>So, how do you build a preventive maintenance program? Well, first of all, you need a master equipment list. This list is important, whether you're talking preventive maintenance, predictive maintenance, or Reliability Centered Maintenance.</p>
							<p>You have to know what's under your umbrella, and a key time to do that is at building commissioning stage. This is when you’ll have everyone involved in building operations together and you’ll have all the documentation on hand. Put all the documentation together and make sure that that's collected and stored, and filed so you can access it in, say, 30 years. You should also have drawings of the facility, and know how it should be operated. Assign components into logical groups and prioritize components based on importance to the process. We'll talk more about some prioritization of equipment importance when we get to reliability centered maintenance, but it's still important in a preventive maintenance program. You need to look at the components with respect to their importance to the process, and their importance to energy efficiency. Then you have to determine the type of maintenance staff required to perform most maintenance tasks on the equipment.</p>
							<p>You also have to determine how frequently the maintenance tasks are going to be performed. Will it be daily, weekly, quarterly, annually? Every 6 weeks? Every six years? You can use technical manuals, machinery history, your engineering department, good engineering judgment, or root-cause analysis to make this decision. If you have the foresight to maintain good equipment history and machinery history, you can look at the failures in the past, hopefully to figure out why it failed, and take actions to change how you do business, how your maintenance is performed so you can decrease the failure rate of that equipment or component.</p>
							<p>Prepare a schedule of maintenance activities to perform during outages, recognizing that outages and the tasks during outages fall outside of the daily, weekly, monthly type activity. If possible, incorporate a schedule in a computer-based management system.</p>
							<p>It's more accurate, it eases the report generating process, and it's easy to update your system. Some studies have shown that such a system can increase the maintenance productivity, can decrease the equipment downtime, while decreasing the parts inventory. and it also saves on material costs.</p>
							<p>Provide a method to monitor your maintenance performance, using the metrics talked about earlier, as far as downtime and how much reactive maintenance you're doing vs. preventive maintenance, the reliability at your facility, its energy use, <abbr>etc.</abbr></p>
							<p>Predictive maintenance is different than preventive maintenance since it assesses the condition of the machine or the components through measurements. It doesn’t rely on a schedule. It asks the questions: "What type of condition is this machine in? Are there stresses that exist within this component that are degrading this machine at a rate greater than design? Am I operating this machine in such a way that I'm shortening its life?" If I am, then I want to take the action necessary to mitigate the stresses.</p>
							<p>In a predictive maintenance program, you would measure the component stress levels before they can cause a problem. You can measure component stresses through vibration, thermography and oil analysis.</p>
							<p>You can measure the degradation mechanism and evaluate component performance through its power consumption.</p>
							<p>Are there advantages to predictive maintenance over preventive maintenance? Yes, Very much so.</p>
							<p>It can increase component operational life and availability. We're no longer guessing if stresses exist and taking maintenance actions. We're actually measuring whether they do or not. Because of that, it provides us the flexibility to say when and how we need to do maintenance. What tasks do we need to do, and we can schedule these tasks? Since you know the condition of the machine, you can plan when you do the maintenance task accordingly.</p>
							<p>This makes it easier to schedule maintenance hours.  You can schedule it during the day, and you don’t have to schedule overtime hours and associated costs.</p>
							<p>At the same time, you can order your parts. You know when you’re going to do maintenance, so you no longer need to maintain that inventory, that stockpile of parts, you can let your distributor maintain that. This results in significant cost savings in many cases.</p>
							<p>And if things are operating optimally, if your plant is operating at a high degree of reliability and things aren't breaking, you have a safe environment, and your worker morale improves as well.</p>
							<p>There are also energy savings. If the plant is operating as it should be, the components are running efficiently and effectively, you won’t have steam leaks, you won’t be blowing through the steam traps and the boilers will operate at a higher thermal efficiency, because you’ve taken care of issues like scaling.</p>
							<p>Are there disadvantages? yes, of course. Predictive maintenance technologies are expensive. Diagnostic equipment can cost thousands of dollars. One could easily spend tens of thousands of dollars on an infrared camera for example. There’s also increased investment and training of staff. Predictive maintenance technologies are not only costly; they're not intuitive. They require some training to be able to use.</p>
							<p>Different technologies require different levels of training, but none of them are off-the-shelf. They all require some level of training and there’s a cost associated with that.</p>
							<p>Often the savings potentials are not readily seen by management. It's a hard sell to go to management, and say, "I want to buy an IR camera for $60,000.00." It probably won’t be in the budget unless you can substantiate that with some payback, some return on investment, it’s viable. In some cases, you can, depending on the type of facility that you have, and the type of maintenance that you perform with that infrared camera or predictive maintenance. In many cases though, you can’t. And in those cases, you may be able to contract the services instead. That $60,000.00 for an infrared camera just turned into a periodic inspection by contract services for $1,200.00 to $1,500.00 a day, maybe once or twice a year. So, you can glean a report and the information necessary to define the health of the equipment or your systems, and use that to generate your needed maintenance activities downstream, and prioritize them.</p>
							<p>With reliability-centered maintenance, we take predictive maintenance a step further. We recognize that predictive maintenance is costly, as far as equipment and resources, training, and people, etc. We also realize that reactive maintenance across the board is not a good way to do business. We understand that some equipment is critical to our mission and critical to, say, energy efficiency, or in many cases, safety.</p>
							<p>Once we understand and recognize this, reliability-centered maintenance then says, "Let's mold our <abbr>O&M</abbr> program around these differences. Let's do reactive maintenance where it makes sense."</p>
							<p>You’ll have to prioritize your equipment based on its importance. Reliability-centered maintenance looks at the type of failures that are likely to occur with your key components or with mission important components as you define them. These components generally have some type of failure rate associated with them, just because of the nature of their function and how often they are used. The failures will have some type of effect upon your mission and upon what you deem as important. So, what reliability-centered maintenance does is try to aim resources at predicting the failures that have the greatest impact to your mission or system. This includes aspects of reactive preventive maintenance concepts. With some equipment, you may just perform preventive maintenance. With other equipment, you'll perform a combination of preventive and predictive maintenance.</p>
							<p>Reliability-centered maintenance was pioneered by industries that need to be reliable, otherwise, people's lives are lost. For example, Nuclear power plants, airline industries and fossil fuel power plants. These are the types of industries that need a high degree of reliability, but still have limited resources. So, they need to define which equipment and which systems are important to maintain to keep the highest degree of reliability. And they do that with the reliability-centered concept.</p>
							<p>There are three tasks for reliability centered maintenance. First, you define what's important, you define what type of failure modes exist, and the effect of those failure modes on your process. Then, identify effective maintenance tasks or mitigation strategies. Based on that, you determine what maintenance activities you can perform so that those failures don't occur. Then you would integrate that into your existing maintenance program.</p>
							<p>There are many of the same advantages that we see with predictive maintenance technologies. There’s increased reliability, reduced chance of sudden equipment failure and lower costs by eliminating unnecessary maintenance or overhauls.</p>
							<p>You’re also able to focus maintenance activities on critical components, increase component reliability and incorporate root cause analysis.</p>
							<p>Are there disadvantages? Yes. The disadvantages include: work force, equipment, and training. Many of the same disadvantages we see in predictive maintenance technologies, because reliability-centered maintenance is so predictive maintenance technology heavy.</p>
							<p>The reliability-centered maintenance, is a premier program, and you can integrate its principles and backfit your own maintenance program. However, it will take some time and effort.</p>
