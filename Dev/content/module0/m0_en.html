	<div class="col-md-8">	
		<p>To support Canada’s goal to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, relative to 2005 levels, federal facilities have committed to take practical steps to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions from their operations.  This course supports their efforts to deliver on their commitments.</p>
        <p>This course has been adapted from the <abbr>US</abbr> Department of Energy’s Federal Energy Management Program training material on implementing deep retrofits. This training is being delivered through the Natural Resources Canada Greening Government Services, to help federal departments and agencies plan and implement projects that reduce the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in their buildings, laboratories, other facilities and vehicle fleets.</p>
