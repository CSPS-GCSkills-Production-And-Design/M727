                            <p>Welcome to Module 5 where we will learn about sustainability as a cycle for continuous improvement.</p>
                            <p>This final module will discuss the implications of revisiting and revising goals and activities.</p>
                            <p> The actions related to this step in the cycle include: Tracking and communicating progress, revisiting goals and making strategic adjustments, and sharing lessons learned and recognizing achievements.</p>
                            <p>Your team should plan to collect new benchmarking data at least every six months to determine the progress of your activities. Facility data can be updated all at once in Portfolio Manager using available Excel templates.</p>
                            <p> Periodic progress checks, such as every 3-6 months, will allow you to:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>compare actual resource consumption data with your team's stated goals.</li>
                                <li>Determine measure effectiveness,</li>
                                <li>Identify mid-course adjustments,</li>
                                <li>Identify best practices,</li>
                                <li>Make informed decisions about future projects, and</li>
                                <li>Recognize individuals and teams for accomplishments</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>During the tracking phase, Team members should provide regular updates on assigned tasks and keep clear records of activities. Be sure to archive:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Meeting minutes,</li>
                                <li>Progress reports,</li>
                                <li>Expense receipts,</li>
                                <li>Survey/focus group/interview notes and results,</li>
                                <li>Activity photographs and video, and</li>
                                <li>Presentations and reports to management.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>A mid-course adjustment that fine-tunes your activities and shifts resources as necessary does not need to be expensive or time consuming. Several strategic phone calls, personal interviews, or discussions with your team or a group of department employees can reveal much about what&rsquo;s working well, what&rsquo;s not, and why. </p>
                            <p> Include a diverse group of respondents&mdash;both demographically different and from different workspaces or divisions. Assure them that their responses will remain confidential and help improve the project. </p>
                            <p> Look for answers to the following questions:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Are measures yielding results?</li>
                                <li>Is data being received and tracked in a way that is useful for planning purposes and project execution?</li>
                                <li>Are new policies and procedures clear and understandable?</li>
                                <li>Are lessons learned and best practices being documented?</li>
                                <li>What obstacles remain to achieving the goals set?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Listen carefully to answers that may reveal necessary corrections to communications or policies.</p>
                            <p>In addition to reporting, it is critical that your team regularly revisits and revises the Action Plan to learn from and improve on current performance.</p>
                            <p>The key steps in reviewing the Action Plan include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Soliciting feedback on current programming and new ideas from the Energy Action team, management, and employees, including new employees. Be sure to include both veteran and new employees in this conversation.</li>
                                <li>Identifying the critical factors that contribute to meeting or missing annual goals, including the effect of tenant behavior.</li>
                                <li>Identifying and quantifying added-value benefits resulting from your activities, such as employee comfort, increased productivity and job satisfaction, and reduced operation and maintenance expenses.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This is also a good opportunity to assess the need for additional training about sustainability policies and procedures such as:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>New operations and maintenance procedures designed to promote sustainability,</li>
                                <li>Administrative tasks that support energy management, such as reporting, monitoring, and data collection; and</li>
                                <li>Orientation program that illustrate desired behaviors for new employees</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This is also a good time to review internal Team engagement. Teams tend to start off with terrific energy fueled by the excitement of taking on an important endeavor. Without clear goals, expectations, roles, timelines, and resources as well as recognition and celebration for progress made, a Team can quickly lose commitment.</p>
                            <p>Strategic, consistent communication will strengthen your employees&rsquo; understanding, ability, and willingness to support your Team's activities. </p>
                            <p> The Sustainability Team should develop a strategy to communicate their goals, activities, and progress to other building users.&nbsp; It will take consistent outreach and education to foster a long-term culture of energy conservation. Keep outreach fresh by relaying program goals and accomplishments in new ways, for example:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Develop an intranet website or blog to post updates, tips, and special features;</li>
                                <li>Use posters and visual displays to highlight accomplishments and savings;</li>
                                <li>Display a creative &ldquo;milestone marker&rdquo; in a central public space to post progress;</li>
                                <li>Create a special feature in newsletters to spotlight energy-saving employees</li>
                                <li>Submit articles to print and digital media highlighting goals and activities</li>
                                <li>Schedule regular updates at all-hands-meetings</li>
                                <li>Host an event in conjunction with Earth Day or another widely-attended annual event at your facility</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>To maintain support for greening efforts, you should brief management on performance trends and progress.</p>
                            <p>Reporting to your managers allows them to identify areas for continued improvement relative to their priorities and reaffirm their commitment to the project. </p>
                            <p> Reporting results can take many different forms, but any report should be tailored to your audience. Management will be interested in cost-savings, increased productivity, ancillary benefits such as improved morale and building-occupant comfort, and the need to meet departmental and Federal goals.</p>
                            <p>Prepare briefing or summary documents intended for senior management to report on progress.</p>
                            <p>These summary reports should include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>an executive summary of the planning and implementation process;</li>
                                <li>the qualitative and quantitative findings;</li>
                                <li>factors that contribute to meeting or not meeting goals;</p>
                                    <p>the next steps for continued improvement;
                                </li>
                                <li>how results will impact future programming; and</li>
                                <li>opportunities to save more resources and money. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Try to use anecdotal quotations to support key findings. Incorporate photographs taken at activities to illustrate your accomplishments and use clear graphics to illustrate energy and cost savings in your pilot project.</p>
                            <p>The long-term success of your Energy Action Program will hinge in large part on employees&rsquo; consistent support and enthusiasm. Develop a recognition program at your facility to reward individuals and groups that have contributed to your program&rsquo;s successes. This can be formal or informal and does not need to be expensive. It is more important that recognition is public and occurs on a regularly scheduled basis. </p>
                            <p> Consider honoring outstanding contributions by presenting in-house energy management awards. Offer certificates of achievement or publish names of energy savers in the organization&rsquo;s newsletters, </p>
                            <p> Recognition can be made to individuals or teams based on multiple criteria, such as:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Most innovative energy savings project;</li>
                                <li>Most participation;</li>
                                <li>Greatest energy use reduction; and</li>
                                <li>Greatest cost savings.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Forms of recognition can vary; team members can be recognized through:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Formal acknowledgement/certificate;</li>
                                <li>Monetary awards/cash bonus;</li>
                                <li>Awards; and</li>
                                <li>Media attention.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In this course we have reviewed a number of critical measures for implementing sustainable strategies in existing federal facilities.</p>
                            <p> The content of this course covered: The triple bottom line of sustainability and fundamentals of sustainable facility management, broadening routine practices to include sustainability measures and meet goals, forming a multidisciplinary team to baseline and benchmark projects to ensure progress, selecting and implementing sustainability measures with multiple benefits and cross-cutting impacts and creating a structure for continuous improvement and resources available for assistance and training.</p>
                            <p> There are a number of strategic objectives that should be considered when evaluating sustainability policies.</p>
                            <p> Policies should:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Establish energy accountability by Instituting a chain-of-command, defining roles in the organization, and providing the authority for personnel to develop and implement energy management procedures.</li>
                                <li>Ensure continuous improvement by developing provisions for evaluating and updating energy management policy to reflect changing needs and priorities.</li>
                                <li>Align with Departmental Strategic Sustainability Goals.</li>
                                <li>Set performance goals that link sustainability goals to your Department&rsquo;s fiscal and mission-critical objectives. and</li>
                                <li>Whenever possible, reinvest energy savings in facility improvements.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Together, we can lead by example and create a more sustainable future.</p>
                            <p>NRCan and other federal organizations provide valuable resources, guidance, and training to assist you in the development of sustainable strategies.</p>
                            <p>Examples of available resources include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change</li>
                                <li>The Federal Sustainable Development Strategy (FSDS)</li>
