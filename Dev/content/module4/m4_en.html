                            <h2>Module 3, Engaging your Organization for Maximum Impact.</h2>
                            <p>This module will discuss best practices for organizing an interdisciplinary sustainability team and determining your facilities initial baseline and subsequent benchmarks for energy and water use, greenhouse gas emissions, and sustainability measures.</p>
                            <p>In this module, we will cover important aspects related to team engagement and the measurement of operational performance.</p>
                            <p>This stage of the process includes the formation of a sustainability team, the measurement of baseline performance and the establishment of performance benchmarks.</p>
                            <p>In the following slides, we will discuss the importance of:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Identifying and engaging key team members to play important roles,</li>
                                <li>Using software tools for energy performance benchmarking, such as ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager, or RETScreen.</li>
                                <li>Establishing clear baselines for tracking progress and</li>
                                <li>Developing an effective action plan based on well-informed goals and strategies.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Energy and facility managers are directly involved in a range of energy and resource efficiency improvements. From new construction, to retrofits, to equipment upgrades, and installation of controls. Successful projects require the coordination of individuals with diverse roles and responsibilities. Buy in and support are critical at individual and group levels. Incorporating sustainability into current projects usually requires you to expand your project team to include various resource specific disciplines. A sustainability or green team, that includes an interdisciplinary perspective, can provide comprehensive and effective solutions. <br /><br /> A Green team is usually led by a Sustainability Champion, who is committed and enthusiastic about making a change towards a more sustainable facility. Sustainability champions should surround themselves with a core team comprised of key stakeholders such as energy managers, property managers, procurement officers or sustainability coordinators. Additional team members should also participate in the green team discussions to provide an outside perspective on the initiatives at hand. Additional team members include Human Resources representatives, finance officials, O&amp;M contractors and others.<br /><br /> Sustainability operations are unique to the facility&rsquo;s context, so gather your team accordingly. Work with management to help identify and recruit employees with a role to play, such as those involved in procurement, recycling, and other waste-management-related job tasks.</p>
                            <p>The size of your team may depend on the size of your organization but should have enough members to explore holistic solutions.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>In all cases, a sustainability team will be responsible for selecting, coordinating, and implementing a project.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;It will also track progress, including benchmarking, monitoring, and evaluating performance. Finally, the team effort should include recording best practices, delivering training, communicating results, celebrating achievement, and providing recognition.</p>
                            <p>Human behavior is a frequently overlooked element in achieving aggressive building performance goals.</p>
                            <p>Changing behavior requires understanding occupant and user habits and motivations. Be sure to include individuals on your sustainability team that can help pinpoint and address occupant behaviour issues and promote change using targeted outreach and education.</p>
                            <p><br /> The most common performance inefficiencies caused by human behaviour include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>New or unfamiliar building technologies</li>
                                <li>Lack of understanding, education and training</li>
                                <li>Inaccessible information or ineffective feedback mechanisms and</li>
                                <li>Cultural norms and institutional protocols that do not foster sustainability</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Deploying an action plan to address barriers has three main parts.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>First, creating an effective communications plan includes the projects objectives, how they will be implemented, and expectations for occupants. Messages should be delivered and reinforced by senior management and sustainability team members in person, in presentations, and on the site&rsquo;s intranet.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Second, education and training should provide the foundation for continuous improvement through workshops or other training.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Third, effective feedback tools should include focus groups and surveys. The key for successful messaging is to show that the project is aligned with the organization's mission and sustainability vision and promotes the occupant&rsquo;s stewardship responsibility. <br /><br /> The Action Plan should integrate the following principles:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Awareness of the need for change</li>
                                <li>Desire to participate and support the project</li>
                                <li>Knowledge of what is required</li>
                                <li>Ability to implement new skills and associated behavior</li>
                                <li>Reinforcement to keep change in place</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Your facilities long-term success will hinge on an ability to collectively create and adopt a sustainability ethic. Studies show that fostering a culture of sustainability requires supportive resources and policies that empower change, well-trained program staff, and engaged senior management.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>A successful sustainability policy will set the stage for long-term success, clearly define what sustainability means for employees, and demonstrate how it helps the department meet its critical mission.</p>
                            <p>Prior to any launch, prepare a briefing to gain support of senior management. This step is critical to the success of a sustainability action plan as the support from senior management can make or break any given initiative.<br /><br /> Once a team has been assembled, the first step is to organize a kick-off meeting to develop a plan and schedule future meetings.<br /> At the kick-off meeting, introduce team members and roles, and set expectations.<br /> The next step is to determine a baseline of building performance and establish a performance benchmark for which to aim for. From there, team members can identify problems and opportunities for improvement and, as a group, justify efforts to move forward and make a change.<br /> The first project that a team takes on should be one that is simple and provides quick results and payback. This will help build momentum and gain further support from senior management.</p>
                            <p>Your team's first task should be to establish a baseline and benchmark of energy consumption, water use, and greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>A baseline establishes a facility&rsquo;s energy or water use for a set period, as a point of reference for future comparison. A baseline provides the starting point for setting goals and evaluating future efforts and overall performance. 12 months of data provides a solid baseline for most facilities.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Benchmarking is a process to account for and compare a metered building's current performance against its own baseline, or against other similar types of buildings.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Benchmarking can chart progress on several important data sets which can help inform goals, set targets and timelines, document resource use, verify uses and costs of energy, water and Greenhouse gas emissions, pinpoint energy and water leaks and identify billing errors.</p>
                            <p>ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager is an online management and tracking tool, most widely used for measuring energy and water use in buildings. It includes features to manage energy and water consumption, rate building energy performance, estimate your carbon footprint, set investment priorities, verify and track progress of projects, gain recognition, access related tools, and track other third-party certifications.</p>
                            <p>While all buildings can use Portfolio Manager to track and assess energy and water use, there are currently only seven building types eligible for an ENERGY SCORE in Canada.</p>
                            <p>These building type are&nbsp;K-12 schools,&nbsp;commercial offices,&nbsp;hospitals,&nbsp;supermarkets and food stores,&nbsp;medical offices,&nbsp;senior care communities and residential care facilities, and&nbsp;ice/curling rinks.</p>
                            <p>If your building type is not currently eligible for a score, keep in mind that Natural Resources Canada will be developing new scores on a progressive basis, and your building type could be next.</p>
                            <p>Taking the right steps to ensure that benchmarking data is consistent and accurate may take some time but will lay a solid foundation for sustainability initiatives.<br /> Be sure to develop a benchmarking plan to outline a strategic approach to the process,<br /> Document a clear picture of how the data is currently being measured and used. <br /> Consider bringing on a outside consultant or third-party provider, like an Energy service company (ESCO), to guide the process<br /> Consistently train all staff involved in the data collection and input process<br /> Use available tools and resources to make compliance easier</p>
                            <p>Another powerful tool for the management of energy performance is RETScreen.<br /> Developed by the Government of Canada, RETScreen Expert is a software for energy efficiency and renewable energy project feasibility analysis as well as ongoing energy performance analysis.</p>
                            <p><br /> This tool has many functions and can be used to:</p>
                            <p>Perform portfolio-wide analyses, collect information on a facility, perform benchmarking analyses, track energy and GHG emissions and for general performance analyses.</p>
                            <p>This tool is used widely throughout government and industry, some of the key users include: 3M, CRH Canada, Oxford Properties, Canadian Tire, the Coalition of Ontario Universities, National Defence, Public Services &amp; Procurement Canada and Natural Resources Canada.</p>
                            <p>In module 3 we discussed best practices to engage your organization in developing specific measurable goals. This process involves engaging all those who play important roles in achieving these goals, using available tool such as ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager or RETScreen and establishing a baseline and benchmarking your progress.</p>
                            <p>From there, your team can develop a specific action plan based on well-informed goals and strategies.<br /> In module 4 we will discuss steps related to developing, evaluating, selecting and implementing sustainability measures and explore common options for sustainable upgrades.</p>
