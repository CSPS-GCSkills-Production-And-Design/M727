                            <p>How do you measure the quality of your <abbr>O&M</abbr> program?</p>
							<p>Well, there are various metrics you can use, and here are just a few examples. They’re not all-inclusive. </p>
							<p>Work orders generated and closed out, backlog of corrective maintenance, records of preventive maintenance, your safety records, and energy use. I mentioned that a few seconds ago. You can also look at metrics like your percentage of reactive maintenance vs. preventive maintenance, your overtime hours and dollars. The cost of parts, your replacement cost, and things like this.</p>
							<p>Effective operations and maintenance, program management <abbr>OMETA</abbr>. Again, operations maintenance is not just operations, and not just maintenance, but it's comprised of operations, maintenance, engineering support, training, and administration. Each of those entities are just as important as the other.</p>
							<p>You need to look at your operations and maintenance support and training administration and evaluate their effectiveness, and identify any gaps that might exist, so that you can improve your process, and improve your own end-program.</p>
							<p>Here are a few examples you might want to evaluate within your operations structure: </p>
							<p>1) Organizational structure. Does everyone understand it? Is it well documented? Is the interface of your operations program interfaced with other entities? They could be interfaced with the engineering support, with maintenance, and with admin. Is it understood, is it documented, and is it well-defined?</p>
							<p>Situations can arise where maintenance on specific components or systems is not performed properly, because no one understands the job duty or whose responsibility it is to maintain and/or operate that piece of equipment. </p>
							<p>2) Plant evolutions and testing. Are they authorized and controlled? Is someone in charge? Are testing and evolutions looked at to ensure that those processes, when they’re performed, don't cause a safety concern, and they don't cause degradation to your equipment? </p>
							<p>Use approved procedures. Procedures are very important in operating a plant to ensure that the configuration of the plant is as it should be, that operations are performed in accordance with best practices, that you're maintaining your equipment, or you're operating your equipment in a manner that the designer intended those components to be operated on. And we'll talk more about that when we talk about life cycle. </p>
							<p>3) Operating conditions effectively monitored. This ties into what conditions you’re looking at, what parameters you look at, and who looks at these parameters? Operations staff are the ones going out and getting the information from the plant, and then logging it. It's very important that you look at various parameters, perhaps across heat exchangers, or the O2 level in the combustion process for a boiler, these types of things. You should define which are parameters are important to your systems, to your energy consumption, and to the health and welfare of your components.</p>
							<p>4) Maintenance. Is there a work priority system? Or do you just react to what's broke on any given day? Do you have work documentation? Do you maintain records related to your machinery history and your work activities that you can access downstream to determine what type of maintenance activities are being performed, what are the bulk of maintenance activities and are these activities reactive or proactive?</p>
							<p>5) Maintenance program implemented. Is the maintenance program implemented, or does maintenance come to work every day, trying to figure out what fire they need to put out on that day?</p>
							<p>6) Engineering support. The facility may be too small to have a specific engineering department but if that’s the case they may able to rely on a larger facility. In any case, engineering support still needs to be part of an <abbr>O&M</abbr> program. You need to have sufficient staff and resources, either contracted or within your own facility to be able to look at design and modification needs, to interface with operations and maintenance personnel. </p>
							<p>For the most part, operations and maintenance personnel know where all the problems are in the facility. They've operated it and they've maintained it for quite some time. But occasionally the engineering department might come in and define a modification or a plant system change without interfacing with the maintenance and the operation staff. </p>
							<p>They could find out very quickly, for example, that their proposed solution is not the one that's going to work. This connection needs to be made. The data collected and trended needs to be reviewed. As well, the information that operations is collecting needs to be defined and used effectively to determine whether or not the facility is operating efficiently, or whether there are problems with equipment. </p>
							<p>Often, there are facilities where operations do a great job at collecting information, they rigorously log information every four hours or more. They change the charts on the recorders, and file them, and when a certain time period passes, those records are archived and the process starts over. Rarely does anyone look at the information. It may have been years since anyone thought about what they recorded and why. What does that mean for the energy use or the health and welfare of the equipment? You need to take time to reflect on what you are recording, and how is it helping your plant to achieve energy efficiency, or extend the life of your equipment?</p>
							<p>7) Configuration control. Again, engineering or technical support expertise is often required to define the matrix of equipment that you need to operate.</p>
							<p>8) Training. Do you have training at your facilities? It's a key element in good <abbr>O&M</abbr>. Your operations staff need to be trained for their jobs, otherwise, they'll shorten the life of equipment, and you won't operate efficiently.  Do they understand why certain data points are being logged? </p>
							<p>8) The same goes for maintenance staff. Maintenance and operations staff want to do a good job but often are not given the tools they need to effectively do their jobs, and they end up operating the building or maintaining the plant in a way that shortens the life of the equipment or throws energy dollars away.</p>
							<p>You'll need continuing training and some initial training, and one of the key things when you define this training is - does it do what it needs to do? Is it compatible with what the job is, with what the maintenance job is, or with the operations job?</p>
							<p>And then how do you evaluate whether or not the training you have given is adequate, be it on the job,  classroom training or just reading the manual related to a piece of equipment?</p>
							<p>You need to have continuing training. Sometimes, the engineering department may change a new pump or a new motor or a boiler with the latest technology and then not provide the operations staff and maintenance staff the training they need to be able to do maintenance on that piece of equipment or to operate that piece of equipment.</p>
							<p>9) Administration program. Do you have a program in place to document how you do business, what your <abbr>O&M</abbr> program really is? Is work control documented? Is there some place or some entity involved that maintains these records?</p>
							<p>And configuration control. The job isn’t done until the paperwork's done. As discussed earlier, you need to take all the paperwork and organize, track and maintain those records so that they're accessible in 10 or 20 years. It should be available in case someone in the future wants to look back, and ask, "how did that boiler operate 10 or 20 years ago when it was first installed?" Or "How does that compare to where I am today? How much fuel usage do I have today vs. 10 years ago and why?”</p>
							<p>A good <abbr>O&M</abbr> program has an integrated structure with strong ties between operations maintenance, engineering, training, and administration. Operations and maintenance are not just a microcosm onto themselves.</p>
							<p>If we don't operate like this our <abbr>O&M</abbr> program is going to not be as efficient or as effective as we’d like.</p>
							<p>Next, we’ll be going over the maintenance program.</p>
